## Build a Product Landing Page

<https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/>

I learned a little more on how to structure a bootstrapped project. Major pain points in creating this project was the design. I spent a little too much time learning how to use SketchApp to create a logo - not the most productive use of time but it's another skill and it was fun to learn.

The logo bg is the flower of life converted into a hexagon shape. added outter and inner shadows to create depth and layers. The "Plus" is transparent, to kind of show that's the type of company we want to be (if it were a real company).

Had a bit of fun playing with gradients. And kind of stuck with the same layout style only because I'm trying to understand it more, ie. the fixed attachments, background photos / images /gradients with text / imgs / cards over it. Repeatition is mastery, so expect me to repeat the styles I've used here.

Anyways, this wraps up the product landing page.
