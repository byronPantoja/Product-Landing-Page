## Build a Product Landing Page

### Back from a Break

Took some time off this project to do create a WP RSVP site.

<http://.mattandhera.com>

The job wasn't amazing, but I did learn how to create a wp site which the end user can update.

### Things I learned from doing the wp-site that I will apply here

Use bootstrap. I'm sure I could create my own css grids/flexbox...which I tried at first when creating the html/css template for the wp template. But there is so much I still need to learn about organizing my css. I think Using Bootstrap is the best decision because when the clock is ticking it really sucks to think you're done just to find out the find out one thing is out of place. The you try to fix it and it creates another problem and so on until you panic and thrash the entire project and start over...but your short on time so you use bootstrap. Then you're like why didn't I just try this earlier...ðŸ˜‚

Now to back to this product landing page.

### Finishing up

I learned a little more on how to structure a bootstrapped project. Major pain points in creating this project was the design. I spent a little too much time learning sketch and creating the logo. But it was fun and will hopefully reward me in the future.

The logo bg is the flower of life converted into a hexagon shape. added outter and inner shadows to create depth and layers. The "Plus" is transparent, to kind of show that's the type of company we want to be (if it were a real company).

Had a bit of fun playing with gradients. And kind of stuck with the same layout style only because I'm trying to understand it more, ie. the fixed attachments, background photos / images /gradients with text / imgs / cards over it. Repeatition is mastery, so expect me to repeat the styles I've used here.

Anyways, this wraps up the product landing page.

### the tests

After taking a break I forgot about the tests to pass the FCC project. So last update to add a form and video. A product video didn't really fit because I couldnt find a free one that was good. So I added a background image instead to the back of the form.
