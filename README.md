### Back from a Break

Took some time off this project to do create a WP RSVP site.

<http://.mattandhera.com>

The job wasn't amazing, but I did learn how to create a wp site which the end user can update.

### Things I learned from doing the wp-site that I will apply here

Use bootstrap. I'm sure I could create my own css grids/flexbox...which I tried at first when creating the html/css template for the wp template. But there is so much I still need to learn about organizing my css. I think Using Bootstrap is the best decision because when the clock is ticking it really sucks to think you're done just to find out the find out one thing is out of place. The you try to fix it and it creates another problem and so on until you panic and thrash the entire project and start over...but your short on time so you use bootstrap. Then you're like why didn't I just try this earlier...ðŸ˜‚

Now to back to this product landing page.
